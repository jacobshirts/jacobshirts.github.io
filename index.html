    <p>chimp females reach reproductive age at the age of 13 while male chimpanzees will be considered adults when they reach 16. The chimpanzees’ adolescence begins at nine years old, way too far
        than humans. By the time a female reaches 9 years, she is ready to start giving birth or having a family for that matter.
        when a chimps lips are pressed together, it’s danger. They are about to attack If you are near and happen to see their lips pressed together, get ready to make a run for your life.</p>
    <p>They are termed as the most intelligent animals in the world apart, of course, from human beings.
        These animals are found in Central and West Africa.A chimpanzee's lifespan in the wild is about 45What is remarkable about chimpanzees is their ability to use tools and the fact they can
        learn sign language which they can use to communicate with human beings. A remarkable fact about them is that they can remember the sign name of people they have not seen for a long time.</p>

    <p ><strong style="font-size:16pt">Gorillas:</strong> strongest and most powerful. one gorilla learnd to use more then 500 words in american sign language. </p>
    <p><strong style="font-size: 16pt">Chimps:</strong> cleverest and can make shoes make tools, an activity long thought to be only dun by humans. somone observed two chimps pick up small twigs
         and use them as tools to fish fore termites in the ground.</p>
    <p><strong style="font-size: 16pt">Orangutans:</strong> are escape artists. an orangutan named bob broke out of three different cages including one that successfully held lins and grizzle bears. </p>

        Gombe chimpanzees use objects—stems, twigs, branches, leaves, and rocks—in nine different ways to accomplish tasks associated with feeding, drinking, cleaning themselves, investigating
        out of reach objects, and as weapons. Chimps also make sponges by chewing leaves and then dipping them into puddles of water, which they can then drink. They also use sticks and rocks
        to smash fruits or hard shells. Tools are not only used for feeding however. Adult males, for example, can enhance charging displays by hurling sticks, branches or rocks to intimidate
        others.</p>
    <p>chimps aren't good swimmers because they can't float well. They have very little body fat and muscular, stocky bodies, so swimming is difficult for them.
        Chimpanzees fight for territory, food and, to a lesser extent, to protect their mates or offspring. The decision to attack a troop of chimpanzees over territory that may offer an abundance
        of food depends more on the number of the chimps in the troop, rather than the size of the individual chimpanzees. chimpanzees are prey to big cats, such as lions, cheetahs and leopards,
        crocodiles and pythons. Chimps will climb tall trees to escape a predator, but if that doesn't work, they can use their extraordinary strength and teeth.Chimpanzees use their strong bite
        and fangs to subdue an opponent. Using their strong muscles, they grapple, slam and wrestle their victims to the ground. They hit, kick, stomp, pull on fur and drag their victims.
         Chimpanzees are able to defend themselves, or begin a fight, by using their great intelligence. When working as a troop, they plan impressive maneuvers and deception to outfox their enemies.</p>

        Monkeys are omnivors they eat leaves grass nuts fruit insects and small animals fruit insects and small animals like ants.
        like humans monkeys can judge distances and som even have thumbs which helps them in their habitat and it helps them to groom ech ather.
        apes are the most inteligentbut Chimpanzees and Goillas are the smartest Gorillas are the strongest and orangutans are the most acrobatic.
        chimps make frendships that last for years even when separated for a long period of time they know ech otherand hug.
        a male orangutan's territory is about two mile's far and the male shouts a warning to protect its famiy from other orangutan's it roars and
        groans for about 5 minits
