            Gombe chimpanzees use objects—stems, twigs, branches, leaves, and rocks—in nine different ways to accomplish tasks associated with feeding, drinking, cleaning themselves, investigating
            out of reach objects, and as weapons. Chimps also make sponges by chewing leaves and then dipping them into puddles of water, which they can then drink. They also use sticks and rocks
            to smash fruits or hard shells. Tools are not only used for feeding however. Adult males, for example, can enhance charging displays by hurling sticks, branches or rocks to intimidate 
            others.</p>
